## Development

To get started, run the `yarn install` command.

### Example server

The local server provides the ability to test changes to the fields while developing
the field types, validation types, etc.

```sh
yarn run serve
```

Then visit [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/) to view example page.

### Writing tests

When writing tests or to have tests be automatically run while making changes use the
`dev` script.

```sh
yarn run dev
```
